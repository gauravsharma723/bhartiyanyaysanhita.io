murder.<br><br> Here A is not guilty of the offence of wrongful confinement;<br> for he was bound by law to apprehend Z, and therefore the case falls within the general exception which provides that “nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is bound by law to do it”.<br><br> (2) Every expression which is explained in any Part of this Sanhita, is used in every Part of this Sanhita in

intention is liable for the act in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone with that knowledge or intention.<br><br> (7) Wherever the causing of a certain effect, or an attempt to cause that effect, by an act or by an omission, is an offence, it is to be understood that the causing of that effect partly by an act and partly by an omission is the same offence.<br><br>

agreement with intent to murder Z.<br><br> Z dies from the effects the several doses of poison so administered to him.<br><br> Here A and B intentionally cooperate in the commission of murder and as each of them does an act by which the death is caused, they are both guilty of the offence though their acts are separate.<br><br> (b) A and B are joint jailors, and as such have the charge of Z, a prisoner, alternatively for six hours at a time.<br><br> A and B, intending to cause Z’s death, knowingly cooperate in causing that effect by illegally omitting, each during the time of his attendance, to furnish Z with food supplied to them for that purpose.<br><br> Z dies of hunger.<br><br> Both A and B are guilty of the murder of Z.<br><br> (c) A, a jailor, has the charge of Z, a prisoner.<br><br> A, intending to cause Z’s death, illegally omits to supply Z with food;<br> in consequence of which Z is much reduced in strength, but the starvation is not sufficient to cause his death.<br><br> A is dismissed from his office, and B succeeds him.<br><br> B, without collusion or cooperation with A, illegally omits to supply Z with food, knowing that he is likely thereby to cause Z’s death.<br><br> Z dies of hunger.<br><br> B is guilty of murder, but, as A did not cooperate with B.<br><br> A is guilty only of an attempt to commit murder.<br><br> (9) Where several persons are engaged or concerned in the commission of a criminal act, they may be guilty of different offences by means of that act.<br><br> Illustration.<br><br> A attacks Z under such circumstances of grave provocation that his killing of Z would be only culpable homicide not amounting to murder.<br><br> B, having ill-will towards Z and intending to kill him, and not having been subject to the

Z on a table in the house which Z occupies.<br><br> Here the ring is in Z’s possession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A commits theft.<br><br> (g) A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the

was not done dishonestly.<br><br> (j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes the watch out of Z’s possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, in as much as he takes it dishonestly.<br><br> (k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z’s possession without Z’s consent, not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property in as much as he takes it dishonestly.<br><br> (l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z’s possession without Z’s consent, with the intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration.<br><br> Here A takes dishonestly;<br>

reading it, and with the intention of returning it.<br><br> Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z’s implied consent to use Z’s book.<br><br> If this was A’s impression, A has not committed theft.<br><br> (n) A asks charity from Z’s wife.<br><br> She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband.<br><br> Here it is probable that A may conceive that Z’s wife is authorised to give away alms.<br><br> If this was A’s impression, A has not committed theft.<br><br> (o) A is the paramour of Z’s wife.<br><br> She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such property as she has no authority from Z to give.<br><br> If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft.<br><br> (p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A’s own property, takes that property out of Z’s possession.<br><br> Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft.<br><br> (2) Whoever commits theft
